		<ol type="1">
			<li>Quake II (registered version)
			<li>Quake II 3.20 upgrade patch
			<li>Weapons Factory client software (.PAK file)

		</ol>
		<p>Installing Weapons Factory is actually quite easy if you already have Quake II installed. Simply follow the instructions below, in order.</p>

		<h2>Quake II</h2>
		<p>First of all, to play Weapons Factory, you must have <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/quake2/index.html" target="_top">Quake 2</a>.  Furthermore, it is recommended that you be a proficient player not only of Quake II, but also of network deathmatch and/or capture-the-flag play. Weapons Factory builds on these network games.</p>
		<p>Second, you will need to have the <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/files/" target="_top">Quake II version 3.2 upgrade</a>.</p>

		<h2>Weapons Factory directory</h2>
		<p>Weapons Factory is designed to operate in its own subdirectory within the Quake2 directory. Thus you will need to create a subdirectory called &quot;wf&quot; within your &quot;quake2&quot; directory. Do this before proceeding.</p>

		<p>You should also create a quake2\wf\maps directory for maps.</p>
		
		<h2>Weapons Factory client components</h2>
		<P>Next, you will need to install the WF files. Download the latest WF client file from the <A HREF="http://www.captured.com/weaponsfactory/wf.software.html">downloads page</a>.  Ths includes the <i>pak5.pak</i> file and the Weapons Factory gamespy tab. Unzip this file into your quake2\wf directory.

		<h2>Assorted maps</h2>
		<P>Many of the WF servers will be running maps specifically designed for WF. New maps are constantly under development, and old maps are frequently revised. It is necessary to check the download section regularly.</p>
		<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.captured.com/weaponsfactory/wf.software.html">Weapons Factory Maps</a> (official  WF maps)<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If you have correctly installed current maps, then your quake2\wf\maps directory should look something like this:</p>
		<center><img src="gfx/explorer.mapsdir.gif" width=550 height=396 border=0 alt="Sample Explore view of WF maps directory"></center>
		
		<!-- <h2>Weapons Factory server component</h2>
		<p>For those of you who want to set up your own server, you will need to download the wfserver.zip file from the download section.</p> -->

		<h2>Launching Weapons Factory </h2>
		<p>It is important to remember, however you choose to launch Quake 2 for Weapons Factory play, that the command line must instruct Quake 2 to run the Weapons Factory mod. The correct command line is:</p>
		<blockquote><blockquote><pre>quake2 +set game wf</pre></blockquote></blockquote>
		<p>It is highly recommended that you review the rest of the documentation in the Handbook before playing, as Weapons Factory is a complex game. Most features require <a href="wfdocs.controls.html">special key bindings</a> to operate. Please review these bindings <a href="wfdocs.controls.html">here</a>, rather than irritating other players by asking binding questions during a game.</p>
